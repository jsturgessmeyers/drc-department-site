# DRC Department Site

#### A new website for a new department.

Our entire department went through a rebranding and management wanted a new website to go with it. The dev team worked with the lead designer and copywriter to develop a clean, responsive site.

The interesting thing is the index page. We wanted something to show off a bit of our collective personality. I shot video of people drawing pictures and edited them down to about 20s, ending with a still image of the final drawing. The video/image is pulled in randomly on page load. Check out the site [here](http://drc.thehiddenrift.com), and reload the page for a different video. Also note the controls at the bottom-right which allow you to show/hide the overlay and also replay the video.

This project was on an extremely tight timeline and in fact was never completed. Subsequent internal restructuring eventually put this work on hiatus.
